                            existing Control Panel.[1] It provides access to the main configuration options and settings for a user's PC. While very
                            similar to the original Control Panel, the new Settings menu features categories of possible user interactions and
                            activities, rather than simply listing all devices and options, from whom a user is supposed to choose.</p>

                            <h4>Speed Up</h4>
                            <p>speedup is a number that measures the relative performance of two systems processing the same problem. More technically,
                            it is the improvement in speed of execution of a task executed on two similar architectures with different resources.
                            The notion of speedup was established by Amdahl's law, which was particularly focused on parallel processing. However,
                            speedup can be used more generally to show the effect on performance after any resource enhancement.</p>

                            <p>Privacy settings are "the part of a social networking website, internet browser, piece of software, etc. that allows you
                            to control who sees information about you."[1] With the growing prevalence of social networking services (SNS),[2][3]
                            opportunities for privacy exposures also grows.[4] Privacy settings allow a person to control what information is shared
                            on these platforms.

                            <p>A backup system contains at least one copy of all data considered worth saving. The data storage requirements can be
                            large. An information repository model may be used to provide structure to this storage. There are different types of
                            data storage devices used for copying backups of data that is already in secondary storage onto archive files.[note
                            1][4] There are also different ways these devices can be arranged to provide geographic dispersion, data security, and
                            portability.</p>

                            <p>Client certificates are less common than server certificates, and are used to authenticate the client connecting to a
                            TLS service, for instance to provide access control. Because most services provide access to individuals, rather than
                            devices, most client certificates contain an email address or personal name rather than a hostname. Also, because
                            authentication is usually managed by the service provider, client certificates are not usually issued by a public CA
                            that provides server certificates.</p>

                            locally on an individual computer or its attached storage (such as a CD). Online databases are hosted on websites, made
                            available as software as a service products accessible via a web browser. They may be free or require payment, such as
                            by a monthly subscription. Some have enhanced features such as collaborative editing and email notification.</p>
